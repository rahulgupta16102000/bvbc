								<h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:20px;"><i><u>ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN MALLS</u></i></h2>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The use of energy in buildings has increased in recent years due to the growing demand of energy used for heating and cooling in buildings.Lighting is a major contributor to the energy costs in -commercial buildings.The word "mall" depicts various meanings in terms of shopping, entertainment, movies and eating outlets. The meaning of this word is different for different people as it depends upon their activity they perform there.In simple language a shopping mall can be defined as "A shopping mall is a large shopping centre entirely within a roofed structure, controlled by a limited number of entrances. Stores and other services are only accessible via interior corridors".Because of the threat from the change in climate, owners and managers of the mall have decided for "GO GREEN".To reduce overall energy consumption in buildings and lighting & HVAC are the major nergy consumers. The built environment is responsible for up to 40% of total energy use. In India, building sector represents 33% of energy consumption. (Energy Conservation and Building Code, July 2009) Energy efficient systems can reduce the power consumption by 50% in existing buildings and 35% in new construction. Some 15-30% of total electricity consumption can be reduced by applying green lighting.<a href="http://shodhbhagirathi.iitr.ac.in:8081/jspui/image/pdf/web/viewer.html?file=/jspui/bitstream/123456789/1994/1/APDG21858.pdf"></a>.</p>
								<p style = "font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;"><u>Problem Identification:</u></p>
							    <p>Among all the sectors, commercial sector contributes 7% of energy cost. And being a major commercial building, Shopping mall consumes a large amount of energy in space heating, cooling, lighting, lifts, escalators etc. But as the growth of mall is increasing at faster pace there is a great scope of work in understanding, its efficiency. Because of the growing demand of heating and cooling within the building the consumption of energy has increased a lot, first goal for future energy efficiency measures should be to reduce energy demand. Hence, the energy efficiency in a shopping mall is one of the major agenda to save its consumption and to reduce electricity bill.</p>
								<p>The major areas of energy consumption in malls are as follows:</p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:20px;"><i><u>SOLUTION</u></i></h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style = "font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">HVAC SYSTEM</p>
								<p>The term “HVAC system” is used to refer to the equipment that can provide heating, cooling, filtered outdoor air, and humidity control to maintain comfort conditions in a building. Not all HVAC systems are designed to accomplish all of these functions. Some buildings rely on only natural ventilation. Others lack mechanical cooling equipment (AC), and many functions with little or no humidity control.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The methods to reduce energy consumption are:</p>
								
								<ol type="1">
                                <li><u>Keep up with routine maintenance:</u> If you don’t already have a proactive maintenance program for your HVAC system, it’s a good idea to schedule semi-annual service with a qualified HVAC service company. They can make sure your system is operating at its most efficient settings and that parts or components are in good working order.</li>
                                <li><u>Operate your HVAC system at optimum and stable temperatures:</u> The temperature you set your thermostat is largely a matter of personal comfort, but many systems have optimum temperature ranges that ensure they’re using energy efficiently. Consult your owner’s manual or with your service technician to find out the most energy-efficient temperature range. It’s also a good idea to avoid fluctuating temperatures too frequently – such as turning the AC way down on a hot day – as this can make your HVAC system work harder and less efficiently.</li>
                                <li><u>Beef up your insulation:</u> Particularly in old malls, inadequate insulation is another factor that can lead to losing heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. If you’re unsure about your home’s insulation levels, consult with an energy auditor or insulation professional for guidance.</li>
								<li><u>Turn down the thermostat:</u> Setting the thermostat to the coolest temperature in the winter or highest temperature you find comfortable can seem like a small step, but the energy savings can be substantial. According to a study, setting your thermostat back 10 to 15 degrees for 8 hours at a time during the heating season can save you 5 to 15 percent in heating bills each year.</li>
								<li><u>Change your air filters regularly:</u> Changing your HVAC system’s air filters once a month, or as directed by the furnace or filter manufacturer, helps ensure your system has smooth, uninterrupted air flow.</li>
								<li><u>Use curtains, blinds and drapes to help control temperatures:</u> Window coverings can have a big effect on malls heating or cooling load. In cooler months, harness the sun’s free warmth by keeping curtains, blinds or drapes open on south-facing windows during the day to allow sunlight in. Close them at night to add an extra layer of insulation between the glass and your home interior. In the summer, keep window coverings closed during the day to reduce temperatures.</li>
                                </ol>
								
								<p style = "font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">LIFTS AND ESCALATORS</p>
								<p>India's elevator and escalator market is the world's second largest, next to China. Annual demand rose to 48,000 units in 2015 and is expected to continue growing. The market for elevators in India is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 8% between 2016 and 2021 with the size of the market forecast to cross $1.6 billion in 2020, according to research firm TechSci Research. According to latest reports, passenger elevators grabbed the largest volume share in India's elevators market, on account of increasing number of housing projects, premium hotels, government infrastructure development projects such as 100 smart cities, etc.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The methods to reduce energy consumption are:</p>
								
								<ol type="1">
                                <li><u>Destination Control System (DCS):</u> A destination control system or optimum elevator operating system uses a kiosk with a touchscreen in the lobby that replaces traditional elevator call buttons. Each person has a personalized card that helps the system track the passengers' pattern of movement to direct people to the elevator that will get them to where they are going the fastest. This new elevator technology groups people going to the same floor to create less wait time, less travel time, and more efficient rides thus shortening the time passengers spend waiting for and riding elevators by 30 percent. Combining a smarter system with an energy efficient elevator will decrease energy bills substantially.</li>
                                <li><u>Solar powered elevators:</u> This latest innovation in elevator technology boasts an energy savings of up to 50 percent per year, in comparison to a conventional model. The new elevator can run on solar energy, power from the grid, or a combination of both. Depending on the configuration and available sunlight, it is possible to run the elevator solely on solar power. Solar panels are placed on the rooftop of the building to create the power for the elevator. The energy that is captured by the solar panels can be used immediately, stored in batteries, or even re-sold to the grid. It offers a unique advantage of having stored power during a power outage thus making it safer to travel in as compared to a conventional one.</li>
                                <li><u>Rope free elevator and MRL technology:</u> It harnesses the power of linear motor technology to move multiple cars in a single shaft both vertically and horizontally. Another kind of elevator technology, called Machine-Room-Less (MRL) technology, incorporates smaller, gearless or highly efficient geared machines, typically using variable-speed and variable-frequency drives with the latest digital technology. These smaller and more efficient machines represent a significant improvement in power consumption by as much as 60 percent over hydraulic elevators and also over traction elevators in significant ways. Certain energy-saving elevators are designed to use magnet system that requires less starting and braking current. Moreover, it uses LED lighting and sleep modes and a regenerative-drive hardware, which not only considerably decreases energy use, it also recycles energy and recharges the system.</li>
								<li><u>Employing variable frequency drive:</u> Installing variable speed drives or use of variable voltage motor controllers can result in energy savings of 15% to 40%.  This alternative is useful with medium traffic.  Regenerative braking can be employed on heavily used down escalators and finally, LED light sources can be installed for skirt guard, comb, and rail lighting.  Lighting improvements alone can result in 1,600 to 2,000 kWh/year of energy savings. </li>
                                </ol>
								
								<p style = "font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">LIGHTNING</p>
								<p>Lighting plays a major role in the creating visual comfort, attractive identity and comfort of a shopping mall. Excessive dependence on artificial-lighting,increases energy consumption. Hence daylighting in spaces along with sensors are introduced. This system involves allowance of daylighting, at the perimeter areas,of a building with the help of building form.Before installing the lights certain design criterias have to be checked which are: Appearance of space and light fixtures,  Color appearance, Direct glare, Horizontal and vertical illuminance, Light distribution on surfaces, Points of interest</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The methods to reduce energy consumption are:</p>
								
								<ol type="1">
								<li><u>Combining three or four single-color LEDs</u> to produce an acceptable approximation to an incandescent light source. These are chosen to match at red, green, and blue eye receptors. Amber LEDs are sometimes added to achieve better color quality. One advantage of this approach is that the different LED devices can be dimmed separately allowing users to control the color.</li>
                                <li><u>Use of high efficiency blue LEDs</u> to illuminate a phosphor, which then re-radiates the light over a broad range of colors. </li>
								<li><u>Internally reflective light conduits</u> that bring light from roof collectors into interior spaces</li>
								<li><u>PV devices</u> that are transparent to visible light but convert infrared and other portions of the sunlight into electricity (these devices may cut installation costs for self-powered window and window shading devices)</li>
								<li><u>Daylight harvesting</u> saves energy by repeatedly monitoring and adjusting non-natural and natural lighting to improve occupants' comfort by eliminating variations in lux levels. Light level sensors are used to decide lighting levels on the basis of the sunlight filtering through windows in exact area. If a dimmer sense a lesser amount of light than optimal artificial brightness in an area, it brightens lights to the preferred intensity value. </li>
								<li><u>Occupancy sensors</u> are used to switch the lights off or other loads when people leave an area of a building unattended. Such sensors are often joined with a wall control to offer an option of both physical and mechanical activation/deactivation means. As a result, users occupying an area can by hand control lighting without having to worry about wasting electricity by burning unnecessary lights when the areas are left unoccupied.</li>
								<li><u>Optical system</u> type of daylight harvesting uses a tubular day lighting device or fiber optic system -that provides optically-controlled daylight to modern buildings. The tubular day lighting device is a round tube lined with highly reflective material that leads the light rays through a building, starting from an entrance-point located on its roof to its terminus. Fiber optic day lighting uses fiber optics, together with-solar light collectors, to diffuse daylight to spaces commonly hard to daylight. </li>
                                </ol>
								
								<p style = "font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">ELECTRONIC LOADS</p>
								<p>These include a variety of electronic devices such as computers, televisions, imaging equipment (e.g., printers and multifunction devices), audio/video equipment other than displays, telephony devices, and network equipment. Kitchen and household devices are also included, as are application-specific commercial building systems. Electric vehicle chargers are also included in this category. They are now small, but their importance may grow rapidly in coming years </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The methods to reduce energy consumption are:</p>
								
								<ol type="1">
								<li>Employing of neural networks/better codes in PC/LAPTOP to increase the processing speed of computers.</li>
								<li>Keeping the showcase units on shut down instead of sleep to prevenet non linear loads.</li>
								<li>Utlizing INDUCTION cooktop in restraunts to make instant food items instead of using LPG.</li>
